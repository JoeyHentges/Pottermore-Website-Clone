Harry Potter Pottermore Website: https://www.wizardingworld.com/

A for fun project that copies the design of the Pottermore website. I wanted to test myself to see how close I could replicate some of the features of the website.

This is a clone of other projects I have worked on so there may be files that don't match this project.

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
